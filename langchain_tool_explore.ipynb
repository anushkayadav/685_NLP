At that time, the working day could range from 10 to 16 hours, the work week was typically six days, and child labour was common. In 1593, Spain became the first country to introduce the eight-hour work day by law for factory and fortification workers. In contemporary era, it was established for non-agricultural workers by Uruguay in 1915, and for all professions by Soviet Russia in 1917.',\n"," 'source':
